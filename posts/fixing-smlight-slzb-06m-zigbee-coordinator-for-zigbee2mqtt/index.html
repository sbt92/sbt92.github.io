Wanting to avoid the same situation again I decided to purchase the <a href=https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004942648430.html>SMLIGHT SLZB-06M</a> to replace it after a recommendation from a friend. I liked that it gave me the choice to serve the coordinator either over USB or TCP. Decoupling the coordinator from the server did give me plenty of flexibility in the future to where I could put my server without impacting the Zigbee network.</p><p>While it was advertised as plug and play, I found that I still needed to take a few steps to get it working with Zigbee2MQTT. The deprecated EZSP driver functions but the recommended Ember driver does not. If you find yourself with this coordinator you can test this out of the box by setting <code>adapter: ember</code> in your Zigbee2MQTT configuration.yaml. If Zigbee2MQTT will not start change the configuration.yaml to <code>adapter: ezsp</code>. If Zigbee2MQTT starts with the EZSP adapter set in your configuration you&rsquo;ve identified that the SMLIGHT SLZB-06M needs a firmware update.</p><p>To perform the firmware update the SMLIGHT SLZB-06M provides its own admin console on your network if your coordinator is connected to the LAN. Once you&rsquo;ve accessed the admin console via its IP address on your network navigate to <strong>Settings and Tools</strong> and then <strong>Firmware update</strong>. Click the <strong>Check for Zigbee updates</strong> button. Under the Zigbee Coordinator section you want the installed firmware version to be 20250220 or later. If it is not at that version click the <strong>Flash Zigbee Coordinator 20250220</strong> button. This process usually takes a couple of minutes. Once completed set <code>adapter: ember</code> in your Zigbee2MQTT configuration.yaml. Zigbee2MQTT should start up now and you can go through the process of pairing your devices again.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2021 - 2025 Sam Tripp - All Rights Reserved</footer></body></html>
