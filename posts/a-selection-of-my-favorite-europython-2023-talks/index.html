If you&rsquo;re holding off of booking your first conference for various reasons or are unsure of which one to attend I found EuroPython a very friendly and welcoming conference, that is tailored to the developer. I found the conference fairly priced for the value that I got out of it. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t comment on the tutorials or the sprints as I did not attend them.</p><p><strong>Would I go to another conference after that experience</strong>: Yes - I went to <a href=https://fosdem.org/2024>FOSDEM 24</a></p><p><strong>Would I go to EuroPython again</strong>: Yes, I will give it a couple of years before going again as I&rsquo;ve now got a taste for attending Software Engineering conferences so I would like to check others out first but no doubt I will return in the future.</p><p>The key purpose to this blog post is to reflect on a selection of talks that I found valuable or enjoyed during the conference. There was a wide selection of talks to attend although sadly I could not attend them all. Most of the talks I attended were aimed towards a DevOps audience.</p><h1 id=cli-application-development-made-easier-with-typer--vinícius-gubiani-ferreira>CLI application development made easier with typer — Vinícius Gubiani Ferreira</h1><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bLTwNZiMLBE?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLTwNZiMLBE">Watch on Youtube</a></p><p>This talk introduced me to the Typer library. As someone who has built CLI&rsquo;s in the past using such libraries as Argparse and Fire, I quickly discovered that Typer is a game changer. You can get a CLI app running in no time at all using this. I created a proof of concept CLI thanks to this talk. If I was to make a CLI application in the future this would be my go to library.</p><h1 id=optimizing-your-ci-pipelines--sebastian-witowski>Optimizing Your CI Pipelines — Sebastian Witowski</h1><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/goWcDalv_FQ?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goWcDalv_FQ">Watch on Youtube</a></p><p>This talk could not have come at a more appropriate time for me, as when I returned to work I was going to have to spend a lot of time creating pipelines. Some solid advice and recommendations around pipeline creation that I was able to utilise immediately.</p><h1 id=pip-install-malware--max-kahan>pip install malware — Max Kahan</h1><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hfoCh4yuJpo?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfoCh4yuJpo">Watch on Youtube</a></p><p>Nothing in this talk was a great shock to me. Plenty of bad actors are deploying malicious packages on PyPI. That being said it was a very well presented talk and is a great reminder to not just blindly install anything off the internet. The key takeway could extend beyond the Python ecosystem.</p><h1 id=designing-a-human-friendly-cli-for-api-driven-infrastructure--oliver-rew>Designing a Human-Friendly CLI for API-Driven Infrastructure — Oliver Rew</h1><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6LeB5j331bU?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LeB5j331bU">Watch on Youtube</a></p><p>A great talk discussing closely coupled API&rsquo;s and autogenerated CLI&rsquo;s based off the API documentation. I can think of plenty of times in the past where I would have benefitted from such tooling. The only downside is that this tool is not publicly available, however the insight into well designed tooling was valuable.</p><h1 id=from-idea-to-production--honza-král>From idea to production — Honza Král</h1><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02XHM_XvsWs?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02XHM_XvsWs">Watch on Youtube</a></p><p>A self declared opinionated checklist for going from an idea into production. The example given was for a Django website but I would say it could be applied to most development projects. Key point to note is setting ideas up with the necessary tooling to succeed from the beginning will save a lot of pain retrofitting it once you&rsquo;ve gone to production.</p><h1 id=honerable-meantion-for-lighting-talk-fk-it---how-to-fix-production-code-in-5-minutes--sebastien-crocquevieille>Honerable meantion for lighting talk F**k it - How to Fix Production Code in 5 Minutes — Sebastien Crocquevieille</h1><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ9UFhmGC9k&amp;list=PL8uoeex94UhFcwvAfWHybD7SfNgIUBRo-&amp;index=65&amp;t=2919s">Watch on Youtube</a></p><p>Bit of light humour to finish off the conference. Content Advisory as you can probably work out there is some bad language in this lightning talk.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright © 2021 - 2026 Sam Tripp - All Rights Reserved</footer></body></html>
